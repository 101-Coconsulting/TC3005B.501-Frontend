## Getting Started

In order to run this Frontend, the following steps are required:

### Installing

The only option currently is to clone the repository locally from GitHub.

#### Using `git`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/101-Coconsulting/TC3005B.501-Frontend
```

#### Using `gh` (GitHub CLI)

```sh
gh repo clone 101-Coconsulting/TC3005B.501-Frontend
```

### Dependencies

The dependencies for this project are managed using [the pnpm package manager](https://pnpm.io/), so it is recommended to use this. However, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) can also be used. The dependencies are automatically managed by `pnpm` in the `package.json` file, so they are installed automatically when issuing the install command.

#### Using `pnpm`

```sh
pnpm install
```

#### Using `npm`

```sh
npm install
```

### Running

To run the Frontend, utilize whichever package manager you used for dependencies to run the project.

#### Using `pnpm`

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

#### Using `npm`

```sh
npm run dev
```

And you're good to go! A new browser window should open and you should be able to see the Authorizer's dashboard.
